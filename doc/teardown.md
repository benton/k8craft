Tearing Down your Google Cloud Minecraft Server
======

1. From the [Cloud Console][1], open a Google Cloud Shell session and enter the following text, making sure you change `us-central1-a` to your server's zone:

        gcloud config set compute/zone us-central1-a
        git clone https://github.com/benton/k8craft.git

If you've used the Cloud Shell for this Project within the last few hours, this step may not be required.

2. Now paste in this:

        ./k8craft/bin/teardown.sh

    The Minecraft and SSH servers will be stopped (their Docker containers terminated). Then you will be asked whether you want to delete the cluster â€“ this is recommended (unless you plan to immediately re-run `./k8craft/bin/deploy.rb`, which will start the containers up again).

    Finally, you'll be asked whether to delete the disk holding all the server's data. Use the tools described in the [maintenance instructions][2] to transfer the data offsite if you need to.

**Deleting the services, the cluster and the disk should stop accruing Google Cloud charges for this software, but if you're done with the disk, the safest thing to do is delete the Project entirely!**
