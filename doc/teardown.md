Tearing Down your Google Cloud Minecraft Server
======

1. From the [Cloud Console][1], open a Google Cloud Shell session and enter the following text, making sure you change `us-central1-a` to your server's zone:

        gcloud config set compute/zone us-central1-a

2. Now paste in this:

        ./k8craft/bin/teardown.sh

    The Minecraft and SSH servers will be stopped. Then you will be asked whether you want to delete the "cluster" (the virtual machine) â€“ this is recommended (unless you plan to immediately re-run `./k8craft/bin/deploy.rb`, which will start the containers up again).

    Finally, you'll be asked whether to delete the disk holding all the server's data. *Careful here!* Use the tools described in the [maintenance instructions][2] to transfer the data offsite if you need to, or just make a snapshot from the [list of disks][3].

**Deleting the services, the cluster and the disk should stop accruing Google Cloud charges for this software, but if you're done with the disk, the safest thing to do is delete the Project entirely!**
